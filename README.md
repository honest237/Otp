# Digisms Pro

A complete English-language digital marketplace built with **Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Drizzle ORM**, ready to host on **Vercel with Supabase PostgreSQL and Storage**.

The interface follows the supplied visual references: vivid blue verification artwork, pastel 3D service cards, recognizable platform logos, a purple promotional banner, product cards, a navigation drawer, and mobile bottom navigation. Original reference-inspired artwork and local logo/font assets are included.

## Portable downloads, browser installation & media

All configured brand icons are now embedded in the source and also saved under `public/brands/`; there are no runtime favicon/CDN requests. Run `node scripts/export-project.mjs` for a verified source ZIP including every bundled asset.

The app supports browser installation at **`/install`**, separate **`/news`** and **`/updates`** feeds with individual media-rich posts, and private **APK/product uploads up to 250 MB** through direct Supabase Storage upload. Storage plan/global limits also apply. See **[MEDIA-PWA.md](MEDIA-PWA.md)** for install requirements, file support, security, and the upgrade.

**Existing deployment:** apply `supabase/upgrade-media-uploads.sql` once after the earlier category upgrade.

## Navigation & growing your catalog

Customer screens now have their own full-page URLs: `/account`, `/notifications`, `/wallet`, `/support`, and `/account/profile`. Category pages use `/store/premium`, `/store/proxies`, `/store/socials`, and any new admin-defined slug. The bottom navigation ends with **Account**, and administration is accessible only by opening **`/admin`** directly—there are no customer-facing admin links.

**Existing deployment:** apply `supabase/upgrade-categories.sql` once before deploying this update. See [NAVIGATION.md](NAVIGATION.md) for routes, redirects, category creation, and private administrator access.

## What is included

### Customer storefront
- Responsive home page, all-service overview, searchable/filterable/sortable product store, and individual product pages.
- Price review, wallet checkout, stock checks, idempotent purchases, order receipts, private deliveries, and CSV purchase exports.
- Service → country → review → number → OTP journey, full number history, copy controls, countdown, status polling, long polling, and provider-confirmed non-delivery refunds.
- Rental quote requests with a real support inbox; no speculative rental payload is submitted.
- Ashtech Pay Direct API wallet funding (Mobile Money and USDT), country-based signup currencies, account registration/login, in-app notifications, app news, and customer support tickets/replies.
- Full-page customer screens and a history-aware navigation drawer. Browser and Android system Back navigate between real routes naturally.

### Administrator workspace (`/admin`)
- Overview with actual sales, customer, inventory, and activation data. Charts do not fabricate revenue or growth figures.
- Database-managed categories with clean URLs, editable appearance/order/visibility, reusable product-form templates, and custom fields for future product types.
- Official brand logos, custom image uploads, price/compare-at-price, stock, product badges, publication/archiving, and public product metadata.
- Four delivery modes: manual fulfillment, shared instructions, one-use private inventory, and signed private file downloads.
- Customer suspension/reactivation, audited wallet adjustments, purchase tracking, verified deposit approval, manual fulfillment, and exactly-once wallet refunds.
- Global SMS percentage markup, product price editing, maintenance mode, registration control, store name/tagline/support settings.
- News and in-app notification publishing/archiving, support replies, audit log/CSV export, and a protected NumberOTP operations console.
- Manual reconciliation for ambiguous provider provisioning timeouts; a timeout does not silently create a second number or assume that the provider did not charge.

## Boost (SMM services) — SMM v1 / SMM v2

Customers open **/boost** (or Services → Boost) and run a four-step flow: platform → category → service → link and quantity, paying from their wallet. They choose **SMM v1** or **SMM v2**; real provider names, keys and raw rates never reach the browser.

- Configure `SMM_V1_API_KEY` / `SMM_V2_API_KEY` (and optionally `SMM_V1_API_URL` / `SMM_V2_API_URL`) in your server environment. v1 = ExoSupplier, v2 = Peakerr. Both use the standard SMM-panel API (`key`, `action=services|add|status`).
- Set the markup in **Admin → Pricing & margins** (default 35%).
- **Existing deployment:** apply `supabase/upgrade-smm.sql` once (or run `npx drizzle-kit push`). Fresh installs get the `smm_orders` table from `supabase/schema.sql`.
- Wallet is debited when the order is placed. Cancelled orders are refunded in full; partially delivered orders are refunded for the undelivered share. If the provider can't be reached, the order goes to "Being checked" instead of being refunded or retried automatically.
- Order status is refreshed when customers open /boost and by `/api/cron/reconcile`.
- In sandbox mode (`APP_MODE=demo`) a sample catalog and simulated progress are used; no provider is contacted.

## 1. Run locally

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, or keep the development sandbox's existing `.env`. Never overwrite working secrets blindly.
3. Start PostgreSQL and set `DATABASE_URL`.
4. Apply the schema with `npx drizzle-kit push`.
5. Run `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:3000`.

The supplied development environment already has PostgreSQL. All database access goes through Drizzle and the `db` export in `src/db/index.ts`.

### Sandbox versus live

`APP_MODE=demo` is a **clearly labeled sandbox**, not a live provider simulation passed off as real:
- Creates a session-specific preview account with $25 of fictional credit.
- Seeds sample listings and app news, but no real accounts or subscriptions.
- Uses a curated set of example services/countries/prices.
- Allocates fictional US 202-555-01xx numbers; a clearly labeled sample OTP appears after approximately 18 seconds while polling.
- Supports demo number cancellation and test wallet top-ups; no real money is collected.
- Preview accounts are ordinary customers. Administrator access requires an actual admin account, even in sandbox mode.
- Blocks all actual NumberOTP console operations, even if a key was inadvertently supplied.

Use a **separate clean database for production**. Never point an explicitly enabled public demo at a live database. `APP_MODE=live` disables demo account creation, does not seed sample products, and enforces normal authentication/administrator roles. If `VERCEL` is present and `APP_MODE` is omitted, the app fails closed into live behavior, not public demo administration.

## 2. Supabase setup

### Database
1. Create a new Supabase project.
2. In **SQL Editor**, run **`supabase/schema.sql` once on the fresh project**. It creates all fifteen application tables, indexes, foreign keys, enables RLS, and creates the storage buckets.
3. Copy the **transaction pooler** PostgreSQL URI (usually port 6543) from Supabase's Connect panel into `DATABASE_URL` for Vercel. URL-encode special characters in the password. Include the recommended TLS option such as `sslmode=require`.
4. Use a **direct connection or session pooler on port 5432** as `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` for schema migration commands. `drizzle.config.ts` prefers this variable for migration work.

Alternatively, use Drizzle migrations to create the tables. Do not then rerun the `CREATE TABLE` section of the fresh-install SQL against existing tables. Apply the RLS and storage section separately if using Drizzle instead of the Supabase SQL installer. Future schema changes can be generated with `npx drizzle-kit generate` and applied through your normal migration review process.

### Security model
- This app intentionally uses **server-side Drizzle with its own password/session authentication**, not the Supabase Auth UI. Supabase hosts the PostgreSQL database and storage.
- RLS is enabled with **no anonymous or Supabase-authenticated application-table policies**. Browser clients cannot read account tables, delivery inventory, or orders through the Supabase REST API.
- The privileged server-side database connection accesses the tables. Session, ownership, suspension, and role checks in route handlers are the application authorization boundary.
- No `NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_URL` or public service-role key is used.
- Database password rotation, backups, point-in-time recovery, and least-privilege database-role provisioning remain deployment responsibilities.

### Storage
Set `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in the **server environment only**.
- `product-assets`: public product/category images, admin-uploaded PNG/JPG/WebP/GIF.
- `product-deliveries`: private customer files, including APK. Downloads require ownership of a completed order; new Storage downloads receive a five-minute signed URL (legacy links use 60 seconds).
- `news-media`: private article photos, videos, audio, and attachments. Publication or administrator access is checked before a short-lived signed media URL is issued.
- Signed direct uploads bypass Vercel’s function body limit: products up to 250 MB, images 10 MB, news video 150 MB, audio 50 MB, and attachments 25 MB. Supabase plan/global limits apply; see MEDIA-PWA.md.
- No public upload/update/delete storage policies are created. The server validates administrator access and file types.
- Without Storage configured, sandbox files up to 4 MB are actually stored in the preview database and served with the same publication/ownership checks. Live uploads require Supabase Storage.

## 3. Initial administrator

For live deployment set:
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`: your private administrator email.
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: a unique, strong password of **at least 12 characters**.

Visit `/admin`, open the sign-in dialog, and sign in with those credentials. The first successful login creates the administrator with a scrypt-hashed password. The reserved administrator email cannot be claimed by ordinary registration.

After creation, authentication uses the stored password hash. Use **Account → Profile & security** to change your name or rotate your password; a password change revokes other sessions. Changing the bootstrap environment password does **not** reset an existing account password. Do not share the bootstrap password or seed a production admin with demonstration credentials. New ordinary users always receive the user role. Admin-only operations do not accept a client-supplied role escalation.

Sessions are random 256-bit tokens whose SHA-256 hashes are stored in the database, with HTTP-only, same-site cookies and a seven-day expiry. Cookies are Secure in production. Suspending an account removes its sessions.

## 4. NumberOTP configuration

Official references used:
- https://www.numberotp.com/docs/api
- https://www.numberotp.com/docs/reseller
- https://www.numberotp.com/docs/reseller/white-label

Set `APP_MODE=live` and `NUMBEROTP_API_KEY`. The documented default base URL is **`https://api.numberotp.com/v1`**. Account operations send `Authorization: Bearer <key>` from the server. Public catalog endpoints require no key.

The live storefront loads the provider's **complete returned service and country catalog**, including stock and current prices. It handles the documented/observed nested response shapes (`data.services`, country objects with English `eng` names, and country/service-keyed price data). Logos are locally included for popular platforms; known additional brands use checked-in, embedded icon files. Unmapped services get an honest generic phone icon, not a fabricated logo.

### Operations coverage

The admin console exposes every operation in the public references consulted:

| Area | Documented paths (relative to `/v1`) |
| --- | --- |
| Catalog | `GET /public/services`, `GET /public/countries`, `GET /public/prices` |
| Activations | `POST /activations`, `GET /activations/{id}`, `GET /activations/{id}/wait` |
| Rentals | `POST /rentals` |
| Reseller profile | `GET /reseller/profile`, `PATCH /reseller/profile` |
| Sub-users | `GET /reseller/users`, `POST /reseller/users`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /reseller/users/{id}` |
| Markup | `GET /reseller/markup`, `PATCH /reseller/markup` |
| Balances | `POST /reseller/payout/convert`, `POST /reseller/payout/withdraw`, `POST /reseller/payments/crypto` |
| White-label | `GET /reseller-public/{id}/brand`, `POST /reseller-public/{id}/signup` |
| Sub-user funding | `POST /reseller-public/{id}/topup/card`, `POST /reseller-public/{id}/topup/crypto` |

That is **23 allowlisted REST operations**, plus global activation and reseller event webhook handling.

Important distinctions:
- Console requests are **administrative provider operations**, not local customer purchases. Provisioning a number in the console spends provider credits without automatically creating a local wallet order.
- NumberOTP reseller sub-users and Digisms Pro users are distinct systems; the console manages provider sub-users explicitly. Provider sub-user events are audited, not automatically translated into unverified local wallet credits.
- `NUMBEROTP_SUBUSER_API_KEY` is required for the two sub-user-hosted checkout operations. The reseller key is not silently substituted.
- Public reseller signup needs a real Cloudflare Turnstile token and subsequent provider email verification.
- Local SMS markup is separate from the provider's reseller sub-user multiplier/override settings.
- The public docs expose `/rentals` but do not publish its request schema. The console accepts the payload you obtain from NumberOTP support. The customer UI collects a rental quote request without charging a wallet.
- No public cancellation/resend endpoint, rental renewal endpoint, or programmatic domain verification route is invented. Customers' live numbers expire according to the provider. Sandbox release is explicitly labeled demo-only.
- Provider approval, account funding, service eligibility, rate limits, and accurate live prices must be verified with your actual provider account before selling. Live provisioning could not be exercised without your credentials.

### Price integrity and activation lifecycle
- Catalog/provider base prices remain integer USD cents. Wallets, orders, and refunds use integer minor units of each account’s assigned currency (XAF/XOF have zero decimal places). USD retail SMS prices are marked up first, then converted to the customer’s currency.
- A fresh provider quote is checked on purchase. A changed price returns a conflict and requires a new review. The provider request includes a `max_price` cost cap.
- Wallet funds are reserved transactionally before provisioning. Repeated requests with the same customer/idempotency key return the original order rather than charging twice.
- Provider-confirmed provisioning rejection is refunded. Ambiguous timeouts are marked `reconciliation`, not automatically retried.
- OTP data is scoped to the signed-in owner. Browser polling runs approximately every five seconds while waiting; manual long-polling supports the documented 55-second wait.
- Countdown uses provider `expires_at` or `expiresAt`; `NUMBEROTP_ACTIVATION_MINUTES` is a display fallback when neither is returned. **A client-side timer reaching zero never independently authorizes a refund.**
- A completed/delivered activation cannot be automatically refunded. Provider-confirmed expired/cancelled/failed outcomes refund once; deliberate administrator refunds are audited.

### Webhooks
Set both the NumberOTP global webhook and reseller webhook URL to:

`https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/webhooks/numberotp`

Configure the matching server secrets:
- `NUMBEROTP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for `x-numberotp-signature`.
- `NUMBEROTP_RESELLER_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for `x-numberotp-reseller-signature`.

Signatures are HMAC-SHA256 over the **raw request body**, compared in constant time. Payload hashes deduplicate events. OTP delivery updates the owned activation and order. Supported reseller events are `sub_user.created`, `sub_user.topup`, and `sub_user.purchase`.

The handler returns a retriable conflict for an activation that arrives before its provider ID has been linked locally. Audit records do not include OTP message contents or provider keys.

## 5. Products, delivery, and payments

### Categorized product forms
- Social media: platform, account/product type, region, included items.
- Residential proxies: bandwidth, protocols, region, IP rotation.
- Premium apps: app plan, duration, device allowance, region.
- Accounts/subscriptions: tier, duration, renewal policy, region.
- Digital goods: format, license, version, requirements.

Only sell accounts, licenses, software, and content you are authorized to distribute. The sample brands are illustrative and do not imply affiliation.

### Unique inventory
For account credentials or individual licenses, choose **Unique credentials or license per purchase**. Enter one private delivery item per line. Each row is assigned to at most one order inside the same transaction as the stock decrement and wallet debit. Adding items preserves existing unsold inventory. Stock is automatically counted. Refunded delivered credentials are not automatically returned to inventory.

Shared instructions are intentionally shared across buyers: do not put a single-use password there. Manual delivery remains available for products that need personal fulfillment.

### Customer funding — Ashtech Pay Direct API

Customer wallet funding now uses **Ashtech Pay Direct API**, not Hosted Checkout and not the former manual-reference deposit flow. Detailed setup and behavior are in **[ASHTECHPAY.md](ASHTECHPAY.md)**.

- Country choices at signup come from authenticated `GET /v1/countries` (active deposit countries). The server assigns the returned ISO currency; it never trusts a browser-supplied currency.
- **Other / country not listed → USD ($)**. This option remains available when the provider catalog is unavailable. The UI does not pretend an unavailable catalog is an empty active-country list.
- Country/currency are fixed on the account to protect existing balances. Existing accounts and orders migrate safely to **Other / USD**, without changing numeric balances.
- Product and SMS prices are converted from the store’s USD base price and debited in the account currency. Receipts retain the actual currency, minor amount, and locked USD equivalent. Admin sales charts sum USD equivalents, never a mixture of currencies.
- Mobile Money supports provider-returned USSD Push, Wave, OTP SMS, and OTP USSD flows. Operators and OTP dialing codes are not hardcoded in live mode.
- USDT uses the active `/v1/crypto/assets` catalog, actual payer first/last name and email, exact returned network/address/memo, and provider expiry. USD accounts can pay USDT or explicitly quote a supported Mobile Money currency; the account itself stays USD.
- The store covers Ashtech Pay processing fees. Network/operator charges outside the store may still apply. The full payable amount and wallet credit are shown before initiation.
- Only a server-reloaded, matching confirmed transaction credits the wallet. Browser redirects, pending responses, screenshots, and provider sandbox responses are not proof of payment.
- Signed, timestamp-checked webhooks are durably recorded and deduplicated. The same credit cannot be applied twice. Timeouts stay in reconciliation rather than launching a second collection.
- Ordinary `POST /api/account` top-up credits are disabled. Admin manual approval cannot approve an Ashtech Pay-linked deposit. Audited administrator adjustments remain available for legitimate, separately verified corrections.

## 6. Vercel deployment

1. Push this project to your Git provider and import it into Vercel. Framework preset: **Next.js**.
2. Configure production environment variables from `.env.example`, especially `APP_MODE=live`, `DATABASE_URL`, administrator credentials, NumberOTP credentials, and the Ashtech Pay variables in ASHTECHPAY.md.
3. Apply the Supabase schema before the first application request. Production does not silently create application tables.
4. Configure Storage credentials and buckets if you want uploads/downloads.
5. Set `CRON_SECRET` to a random value of at least 16 characters. Vercel automatically sends it as a Bearer token to the reconciliation route.
6. Deploy. The build command is `npm run build`.
7. Verify `/api/health`, administrator login, provider catalog/prices, a low-cost live activation, webhook delivery, expiry behavior, and funding policy and an Ashtech Pay merchant-verified payment before admitting customers.
8. Add your custom domain in Vercel. A custom app domain is separate from the provider's optional hosted white-label domain settings.

`vercel.json` includes a **daily** reconciliation job compatible with Vercel Hobby's cron limits. It removes expired sessions/rate-limit windows and reconciles expired waiting activations in bounded batches. Interactive polling and OTP webhooks provide normal fast updates. For a commercial store, configure a more frequent schedule on a plan that supports it and monitor outstanding reservations; a daily Hobby job alone is not an immediate background-refund or payment-reconciliation SLA. The job also drains queued Ashtech Pay events and checks pending payment transactions. No cron retry guarantee is assumed.

## 7. Environment reference

See `.env.example` for annotated values. No real keys are included.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `APP_MODE` | `demo` or `live` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Runtime PostgreSQL/Supabase pooled connection |
| `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` | Optional direct/session migration connection |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Initial administrator bootstrap |
| `NUMBEROTP_BASE_URL` | Optional override of documented API base |
| `NUMBEROTP_API_KEY` | Server-side account/reseller Bearer key |
| `NUMBEROTP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Activation webhook HMAC secret |
| `NUMBEROTP_RESELLER_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Reseller webhook HMAC secret |
| `NUMBEROTP_SUBUSER_API_KEY` | Optional console sub-user checkout key |
| `NUMBEROTP_ACTIVATION_MINUTES` | Display-only expiry fallback |
| `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Server-side Storage access |
| `ASHTECH_API_KEY` | Server-side `ak_...` Direct API key |
| `ASHTECH_USER_ID` | Ashtech Pay merchant profile ID matching the key |
| `ASHTECH_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | `whsec_...` signed payment webhook secret |
| `ASHTECH_BASE_URL` | Default `https://www.ashtechpay.com/v1` |
| `APP_URL` | Public HTTPS app origin for payment callbacks |
| `STORE_FX_RATES` | Optional JSON merchant rates: currency units per 1 USD |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Authenticates scheduled reconciliation |

`.env` is ignored by Git. Set production values through Vercel, not a committed file. No secrets are used in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables.

## 8. Validation and tests

Production validation:
1. `npx next typegen`
2. `npm exec tsc -- --noEmit --pretty false`
3. `npm run build`
4. Start the production application through your hosting/runtime process and confirm `/api/health`. It now verifies all application tables and columns and returns `app: "digisms-pro"`; a database ping alone is not accepted as application readiness.
5. Run `PREVIEW_URL=https://YOUR_DEPLOYMENT node scripts/verify-preview.mjs`. This read-only check verifies that the deployed entry page actually renders Digisms Pro, rejects starter-template content, checks the release identity and cache headers, and opens the store, numbers, admin, signup, and wallet routes. Test the exact URL customers use, not only localhost.

The original browser smoke test is `scripts/smoke.mjs`. Country/payment browser tests are in `scripts/payment-browser.mjs`; mocked Direct API contract tests are in `scripts/payment-contract.mjs` (commands in ASHTECHPAY.md). It requires a running **sandbox** app and Chromium (`npx playwright install chromium`). Run `PREVIEW_URL=http://localhost:3000 node --import dotenv/config --import tsx scripts/smoke.mjs` against a disposable sandbox database. The test intentionally creates sandbox purchases, support records, and archived test listings, and restores modified store settings. It must never be pointed at a real-money production store.

Screenshots and test artifacts are ignored by Git.

## Operational notes

Monitor audit entries, reconciliation orders, provider credit balances, support requests, cron failures, database retention, and webhook delivery. Database transactions prevent duplicate credits/refunds; distributed request throttling uses database-backed windows. For a high-volume live marketplace, add a dedicated queue runner, configurable retention cleanup, email verification/password recovery, observability, and business-specific compliance policies before scaling. News notifications here are **in-app**, not an unconfigured email or push integration.

## Long-term number rentals

The **Long-term rentals** tab on `/numbers` rents real numbers from NumberOTP (`POST /rentals`) instead of sending a quote request.

- Flow: service → country → duration (2h, 4h, 12h, 1–30 days) → review → rent. Prices come from `/public/rent-prices` with your SMS markup applied, and are re-checked before the wallet is charged.
- The wallet is debited first, then the rental is requested with an idempotency key. If the provider refuses, the order is refunded automatically. If the provider's answer is unclear, the rental is saved as `reconciliation` and the wallet debit is kept for manual review.
- Messages are read from `GET /rentals/{id}` while the rental page is open, and stored with the rental. Rentals are paid for time, so they are not refunded when they expire.
- Database: run `supabase/upgrade-rentals.sql` once on an existing database (a fresh install of `supabase/schema.sql` already includes the `rentals` table).
- Needs `APP_MODE=live`, `NUMBEROTP_API_KEY`, and enough provider balance. In sandbox mode the same flow runs with a fictional number and sample messages.

## Websites & Bots (custom development service)

A new **Websites & Bots** category (`/build`) lets customers order custom development and lets you show your portfolio.

- **Order forms:** 10 project types (website, web app, online store, Telegram bot, WhatsApp bot, Discord bot, mobile app, API/backend, fix/redesign, other). Each has its own multi-step brief with choice fields (chips and dropdowns) and free-text fields. The definitions live in `src/lib/dev-forms.ts` and are validated on the server too. Edit that file to add or change questions.
- **Customer flow:** brief, quote, accept and pay from the wallet, chat, receive delivery, approve. Pages: `/build`, `/build/portfolio`, `/build/order/[type]`, `/build/requests`.
- **Admin:** **Project requests** (review briefs, send quotes, message customers, deliver links, cancel with automatic wallet refund) and **Built projects** (add, edit, hide, feature or delete portfolio items, with image uploads).
- **Database:** run `supabase/upgrade-dev-service.sql` once on an existing database (a fresh install of `supabase/schema.sql` already includes the tables). The category is added automatically on first load.
- Payment happens only when the customer accepts a quote. Paid projects appear under **Projects** in the customer's purchases.

## Digi AI assistant (Groq)

A floating **Ask AI** button opens a chat that helps customers find products, virtual number services and prices, start a website or bot brief, check their wallet and orders, and send a support ticket to your team.

- **Setup:** add `GROQ_API_KEY` (server-side only) in your hosting environment variables and redeploy. With no key the assistant switches itself off politely and points customers to Support. No database changes are needed.
- **Models:** `openai/gpt-oss-120b` for chat and tools, `qwen/qwen3.8-27b` when a screenshot is attached. Groq retires models regularly, so override them with `GROQ_MODEL` and `GROQ_VISION_MODEL` if a model is shut down.
- **Safety:** the assistant only reads public catalog data and the signed-in customer's own account. It never sees private delivery content, cannot spend money or change accounts, and customers confirm every purchase themselves. Chats are rate-limited per visitor.
- **Support tickets:** "Talk to a person" creates a normal support ticket (subject starts with "Chat:") including a short transcript, visible in the admin Support inbox.
- Chat history stays on the customer's device for 24 hours and is not stored on the server.

## Notifications, dark theme, coupons, gifting

**Database:** run `npx drizzle-kit push`, or `supabase/upgrade-engagement.sql` once on an existing database (fresh installs: `supabase/schema.sql` already has it). The SQL also adds an "Account age" field to your existing social categories.

**Live notifications.** Every customer has an inbox (bell icon → "For you"). It refreshes about every 25 seconds while the app is open and shows a toast for new items. Orders delivered by hand, gifts received, wallet top-ups, finished boosts and arrived SMS codes create notifications automatically. Admin → Promotions can send a notification to everyone.
Web push (alerts when the app is closed) needs a key pair: run `npm run vapid`, put the three `VAPID_*` values in your environment variables and redeploy. Without keys the inbox still works and the "Turn on push" card stays hidden. On iPhone, push only works after the app is added to the Home Screen.

**Dark theme.** A sun/moon button in the header toggles it; Account → Appearance offers Light / Dark / Auto. The dark colours are generated from your CSS by `npm run dark` (writes `src/app/dark.generated.css`): re-run it whenever you change colours in a `.css` file. Hand-made exceptions go in `src/app/dark.css`.

**Coupons.** Admin → Promotions: percentage or fixed (USD) discounts with optional cap, minimum order, total and per-customer limits, category restriction and start/end dates. Customers enter the code on the checkout screen; the server re-checks every rule inside the purchase transaction. Refunding an order gives the coupon use back. Coupons apply to store products (not Boost or SMS numbers).

**Gifting.** On checkout, "Send this as a gift" takes the recipient's account email (they must already have an account), shows "Sending to Jane D." for confirmation, and delivers to the recipient's own purchases with a notification. The buyer pays; refunding the buyer's order cancels an undelivered gift. Gifts work for every store product (including subscriptions, premium apps and social accounts). Boost and SMS numbers can't be gifted because they are tied to a link or phone number the buyer controls.

**Account age.** Social categories get an "Account age" field (e.g. `2 years`) in the product editor; it shows as a badge on cards and the product sheet, and adds an "Oldest accounts first" sort.

**Animations** are in `src/app/motion.css` and are switched off automatically for people who prefer reduced motion.

## Temp mail (`/mail`)
Customers open disposable inboxes at `/mail` and pick a version ("Mail V1"…); the real service behind each version is never shown.
1. Run `supabase/upgrade-tempmail.sql` once.
2. Set `GRABMAIL_API_KEY` and `TEMPMAIL_PROVIDERS` (see `.env.example`). Keys stay server-side.
3. Versions: v1 GrabMail · v2 smails · v3 MailboxTemp · v4 mail.tm (off by default: its terms require visible attribution and forbid proxying/reselling) · v5 NenzMail (not built yet).
Adapters live in `src/lib/tempmail.ts`; adding a service means adding one adapter object there.
